# Hangman
My code for a Hangman text-based game converted into a Hangman GUI-based game, both in Python. This was a 100% original project,
both the code for the text-based and the pygame-based game were entirely for me. The project overall took a few days, but it 
was my first experience using Pygame, which I'm definitely proud of.
